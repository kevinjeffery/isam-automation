# setup Role
The setup role is used to install utility packages (such as unzip), create the file system structure, create required groups and directories for the datatier deployment.  Most of the defaults can be overridden with host or group variables.
- The first task in the setup role is to install some useful packages.  The default is unzip as it is not included in the minimal CentOS installation.
- The second task the setup role looks after in the creation of the /opt/ibm directory if it doesn't exist.  This directory has a bit of history across multiple platforms, so I also softlink the /opt/IBM directory here.  If this doesn't work for your deployment, you will have to modify the role to fit your layout.  I include the creation of the software repository directory here if it has been defined.  The roles and playbooks will use /tmp if this is not defined.
- The next task is to great any required local groups for DB2 and ISDS instances.  This step allows you to control GID if required.  If you do not include the default idsldap user and group here, it will be created for you by the installation.  You should also make idsldap the primary group for all ISDS instance users.
- The final task is to create the instance data directories for DB2 and ISDS by product they will be used for.  This is an optional but recommended step so the data is located outside of the instance user's home directory.
